To help maintain regular contact in the subgroup, we will be hosting virtual coffeeshops starting this summer. 
The coffeeshops will run on a fixed schedule, and anyone can join when convenient. Participants will bring their own work to the meeting, so it can be a good way to block out a research commitment during the week. We will also use breakout rooms for larger groups, to facilitate quick check-ins and questions.

to be included on our email list for more information. We are also looking for volunteers to host the sessions! 

We are also checking for interest in structured writing groups to start in the future. These closed groups would maintain specific goals and provide feedback on writing during regular meetings.
